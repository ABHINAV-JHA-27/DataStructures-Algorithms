    - Strategy to only load pages when they are needed
    - Paging + Swapping
  - Advantages
    - user can write program for extremely large virtual address space
    - [CPU utilisation & throughput] increases & [Response Time, Turn aruond time, TAT] remains same
    - Less I/O would be needed to load or swap user programs into memory, so each user program would run faster
    - Degree of Multiprogramming increases
    - allows file and memory to be shared by 2 or more processes through page sharing
  - If it is used carelessely, it can decrease performance
- [Demand Paging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Agi0u5Png_U)
  - paging + swapping

  - What?
    - Low CPU Utilisation->Degree of Multiprogramming increases->More Page Fault->Cycle Continues->Thrashing occurs->Page fault occurs tremendously->CPU utilisation decrease sharply
  - Cause of Thrashing?
  - Solution to Thrashing?
    - use priority based replacement algo
    - allocate the exact no. of frames that are actually required

### [üî∞Top Interview Preparation Questions](./Leetcode%20Top%20Interview%20Questions)

This is LeetCode's official curated list of Top classic interview questions to help you land your dream job. Our top interview questions are divided into the following series:

- Easy Collection
- Medium Collection
- Hard Collection  
  to help you master Data Structure & Algorithms and improve your coding skills.

Just like any other skills, coding interview is one area where you can greatly improve with deliberate practice.

Most of the classic interview questions have multiple solution approaches. For the best practice result, we strongly advise you to go through this list at least a second time, or even better - a third time.

- [x] By the second attempt, you may discover some new tricks or new methods.

- [x] By the third time, you should find that your code appear to be more concise compared to your first attempt. If so, congratulations!

Remember: Deliberate practice does not mean looking for answers and memorizing it. You won't go very far with that approach. The more you are able to solve a problem yourself without any reference to answers, the more you will improve.
