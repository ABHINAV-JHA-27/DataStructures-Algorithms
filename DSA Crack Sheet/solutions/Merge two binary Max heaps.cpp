/*
Merge two binary Max heaps
==========================

Given two binary max heaps as arrays, merge the given heaps to form a new max heap.

Example 1:
Input  : 
n = 4 m = 3
a[] = {10, 5, 6, 2}, 
b[] = {12, 7, 9}
Output : 
{12, 10, 9, 2, 5, 7, 6}
Explanation :

Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function mergeHeaps() which takes the array a[], b[], its size n and m, as inputs and return the merged max heap.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n.Logn)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= n, m <= 105
1 <= a[i], b[i] <= 2*105
